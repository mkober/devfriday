description: "Well, it may be the 30th episode, but it's Tim's 40th birthday. And unlike Mark, he's shares that detail. Mark talks about Fleet, debugging, then his topic for today: paying for search, and the subscription model. Instead of a topic this week, Tim just forgets to hit the recording button and leaves us with suboptimal sound."
