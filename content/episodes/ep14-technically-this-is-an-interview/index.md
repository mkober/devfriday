date: "2022-01-21"
description: Totally unprepared as normal. Mark has given up his green screen and almost installed linux on his desktop. They eventually talk about what's in PHP 8, after Mark rambled on about Emacs for so very long. Of course Tim keeps bringing up PHP Storm, and why Mark isn't teaching PHP the right way - well, he's not teaching it at all.
